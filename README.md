# 3B1I-Hackathon-HolidayHacks

Hi there! SSTCian and Judges of the Holiday Hacks organised Hack-a-Thon 4.0

We, the team of 3B1I : Ayush Sahu, Aakash Verma, Abhinav Singh Bhardvaj - (3 Bs) and Anurag Biswal - (1 I) present you the completely redesigned login and 1st layer of our official institute EDRP website.

With this newly designed EDRP, the previous major problems that were present in the old website are tackled and handled modernly.
Since this is just a prototype and is only Front-End as no Back-End is possible without database access, many functionalites are limited but the working for a single request is done nicely.
Some Major Problems were :
1. Only Desktop site was present but with the new website it is completely responsive to different PCs, Laptop and Mobile Devices.
2. Everything was messy and unorganised. The new EDRP shows all fields and details in a healthy and brief manner at the start (i.e. Dashboard) and creates & re-directs to specific section for further details.
3. we were never able to go back to the landing page of our EDRP after login, once we open up something else. To fix this, we creted separate section for Notices as well as dashboard so that we can get to anywhere in the page with ease.
4. The recording was cut from all sides due to screen recorder settings and can distort the full view of the page but you can understand.

-- STEPS TO WORK AND VIEW OUR CURRENT WEBSITE --
1. Start with the login page i.e. Index.html, 
    Username : AAAA 
    Password : 3b1i 
    Click login to go inside the website.
2. from the side navigation scroll any page or field you want to go to.
3. logout when everything is done from the bottom of the nav bar.

NOTE : 
Click fill feedBack Form button from dashboard to re-direct to feed back page
online books redirect to the original http://sstcbhilai.kopykitab.com website.

Still this is just a basic idea of what a transformed EDRP website will look like, isn't it beautiful?
yes there is still a huge possibility and there is no limit on what further we can do...

Future Scope:
As this frontend of the website gets connected via APIs it will enhance the functionality and can be implanted to the honourable college site
